          body: 'If you want to prevent getting poisoned by the water you drink, you might want to make sure that your home has a water filtration system. To put it simply, the water filtration makes your water safe to consume and use to your convenience. It eliminated bacteria, residues, particles, viruses and fungi that could find themselves in your pipes. If you experience any of the following symptoms after drinking the water in your home, the water filtration system might be inefficient or outdated: diarrhea, headache, stomachache, vomiting, etc. If you are unsure about the quality of your water, it is highly recommended to boil the water before use and call a specialist to have it tested. Galaxy Plumbing can provide answers to your questions in the blink of an eye. Our customers matter and we will fix your plumbing inconveniences with a swift and effective method.',
